##Guessing Game
A basic trivia game asking questions about The Simpsons.
I created arrays for questions and answers and using a basic function chose a random question to ask the user.

###Pair Programming Changes
The trivia game built off of the already existing arrays and added an aspect to the alerts that informed the user how many questions they had left.

Also, we added a function that removes questions from the array that the user answers correctly.

Finally, we added a picture of Homer eaiting a donut after the user won the game using html and inserting the image tag into the DOM.
